# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction
**SQL | Power BI | Machine Learning**

---
### Objective

Analyze telecom customer data to identify churn patterns, understand customer behavior, and support data-driven retention strategies.

  1. Dataset Overview
Total Records: 7,000+ customers
Total Features: 32 columns
Data was cleaned, validated, and structured for analysis using SQL and Python.
 2.  Data Categorization

To improve analysis and reporting, the dataset was grouped into the following categories:

🔹 1. Customer Demographics
Gender
Age
Marital Status
State

👉 (Who the customer is)

🔹 2. Customer Lifecycle & Engagement
Tenure (in months)
Number of Referrals

👉 (How long & how actively they are engaged)

🔹 3. Services & Subscription Details
Phone Service
Multiple Lines
Internet Service
Internet Type

👉 (Core telecom services used)

🔹 4. Value-Added Services (VAS)
Online Security
Online Backup
Device Protection Plan
Premium Support
Streaming TV
Streaming Movies
Streaming Music
Unlimited Data

👉 (Additional features influencing retention)

🔹 5. Billing & Contract Information
Contract Type
Paperless Billing
Payment Method

👉 (How the customer is billed and tied to the service)

🔹 6. Financial Metrics
Monthly Charges
Total Charges
Total Revenue
Total Refunds
Extra Data Charges
Long Distance Charges

👉 (Revenue contribution & spending behavior)

🔹 7. Churn & Outcome Variables
Customer Status
Churn Category
Churn Reason

👉 (Final outcome — whether customer stayed or churned and why)

 ### Business Objective

Customer churn is a major challenge in the telecom industry, where retaining existing customers is significantly cheaper than acquiring new ones.

This project helps telecom companies:

- Identify **customers at high risk of churn**
- Understand **factors driving churn**
- Monitor churn trends through **interactive dashboards**
- Predict **future churners using machine learning**

The insights help businesses design **data-driven retention campaigns and improve customer loyalty.**

---

 ###  Power BI Dashboard Insights

The Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive view of customer churn across **demographics, contracts, services, payment methods, and geography.**

 Key Metrics

- Total Customers  
- New Joiners  
- Total Churn  
- Churn Rate  

 Major Business Insights

- **Month-to-month contract customers have the highest churn rate**, indicating lower commitment levels.
- Customers using **Electronic Check payment methods churn significantly more** than those using automatic payments.
- **Customers with short tenure (0–12 months)** show the highest churn probability.
- **Fiber optic internet users have relatively higher churn rates**, suggesting possible pricing or service concerns.
- Customers without **additional services (streaming or security)** are more likely to churn.
- Certain **regions consistently show higher churn**, which may indicate service or infrastructure issues.

### Technology Stack

| Layer | Tools Used |
|------|-------------|
| Data Storage | Microsoft SQL Server |
| Data Processing | SQL Queries, Views |
| Visualization | Power BI |
| Data Analysis | DAX Measures |
| Machine Learning | Python (Random Forest Classifier) |
| Development Tools | Jupyter Notebook, VS Code |

---

### Project Workflow

The project follows an **end-to-end data analytics pipeline**.

 1️⃣ Data Extraction
- Imported telecom customer data from **CSV files**

2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Handled missing values
- Standardized categorical variables
- Structured the dataset for analysis

 3️⃣ Data Modeling
- Created production tables in SQL Server
- Built optimized **SQL views for Power BI**

 4️⃣ Data Visualization
- Developed **interactive Power BI dashboards**
- Created calculated columns and measures using **DAX**

 5️⃣ Machine Learning Prediction
- Built a **Random Forest classification model**
- Predicted customers likely to churn

---

 🔄 ETL Pipeline (SQL Server)

The ETL process converts raw telecom data into structured analytical datasets.

**Steps performed:**

1. Created database in SQL Server  
2. Imported raw **Customer_Data.csv**  
3. Cleaned and transformed data  
4. Loaded processed data into production tables  
5. Created SQL views optimized for Power BI reporting  

---

 ### Power BI Data Modeling

Additional transformations were performed inside Power BI.

 Calculated Columns

- Churn Status
- Age Group Segmentation
- Tenure Group
- Monthly Charge Range

 DAX Measures

```DAX
Total Customers = COUNT(prod_Churn[Customer_ID])

New Joiners =
CALCULATE(
COUNT(prod_Churn[Customer_ID]),
prod_Churn[Customer_Status] = "Joined"
)
```
Total Churn = SUM(prod_Churn[Churn Status])

Churn Rate = [Total Churn] / [Total Customers]

 ### Machine Learning – Churn Prediction

A **Random Forest Classifier** was used to predict customers who are likely to churn based on their demographic, service usage, and account information.

---

Model Development

The machine learning pipeline included the following steps:

1. **Loaded churn dataset** from the SQL view.
2. **Encoded categorical variables** using `LabelEncoder`.
3. **Removed irrelevant columns** such as `Customer_ID`.
4. **Split the dataset** into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
5. **Trained a Random Forest classification model**.
6. **Evaluated the model performance** using:
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report

---

###  Predicting Future Churners

The trained model was then used to predict churn probability for **new customers**.

Prediction Process

1. Loaded **new customer dataset**.
2. Applied the **same preprocessing and encoding steps** used during training.
3. Generated **churn predictions using the trained model**.
4. Exported predicted churn results to a **CSV file** for visualization in Power BI.

This allows businesses to **identify high-risk customers early and take preventive retention actions**.

---

📈 Business Impact

This project enables telecom companies to:

- Understand **customer churn patterns**
- Identify **high-risk customer segments**
- Monitor churn trends through **interactive dashboards**
- Predict churn using **machine learning models**
- Launch **targeted retention campaigns**

---

✅ Final Outcome

- Built an **end-to-end SQL + Power BI + Machine Learning analytics pipeline**
- Developed an **interactive Power BI dashboard for churn monitoring**
- Implemented a **Random Forest model to predict future churners**
- Generated **actionable business insights to improve customer retention strategies**
